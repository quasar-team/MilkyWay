This is how I (Piotr) see this project:

* note few years back this all was not possible (Python toolkits were not yet there)
* it's a simple integration layer for (some) Python OPCUA toolkit
* it's value is in simplicity
* I think that modelling with quasar Design is better for resource-starved projects to modelling by plain OPCUA
* compared to Poverty:
  * it'd be simpler to run (e.g. no C++ involved at all)
* many patterns for similar type of software to profit from, e.g. from flask
